NEXT SPRINT IDEAS:
- Workbench system (proximity crafting)
- Save/load (HIGH PRIORITY - complex)
- Inventory organization (sort, quick-stack)
- Combat system (new major system)
- Advanced building (walls, roofs, furniture)
- Settings UI expansion (rumble controls)

BACKLOG (HIGH PRIORITY):
- Save/load system (complex serialization)
- Boss progression (Valheim-style gates)
- Tool tiers (stone → iron → steel)
- Durability system (resource sink)
- Workbench & advanced crafting
- Advanced building blocks
- Settings menu rumble controls (enable/disable, intensity, footstep toggle)

TECH DEBT:
[ ] Critter visual extraction (reduce critter_spawner.gd from 1,143 lines)
[ ] ITEM_COLORS consolidation (remove duplication from inventory_ui.gd + container_ui.gd)
[ ] Container null safety (race condition if destroyed while UI open)
[ ] Input handling consolidation (player.gd uses duplicate input checks)
[ ] Cloud system extraction (day_night_cycle.gd is 829 lines)

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Container destroyed while UI open (needs null checks)
- Input blocking too broad (player.gd:148)

FIXED IN v0.5.0:
- ✓ ESC key not mapped properly (ui_cancel had physical_keycode: -1)
- ✓ Chest open sound playing multiple times (added UI visibility check)
- ✓ Settings menu parser error (can't override show() in Godot 4)
- ✓ Wrong tool sound spam with controller (added 500ms cooldown)
