CRIMSON VEIL - FEATURE ROADMAP
================================

CURRENT SPRINT: "Storage & Organization" (Next 1-2 weeks)
----------------------------------------------------------
Sprint Goal: Enable players to organize and store resources beyond 32-slot inventory limit

PRIORITY 1 - Storage Containers (Core Feature)
[ ] Container placement system - Place chests as building blocks
[ ] Container inventory management - Each chest has independent inventory
[ ] Container interaction - Click to open, transfer items
[ ] Container UI - Dual-panel interface (container left, player right)
[ ] Container collision and physics - Proper world placement
[ ] Container visual design - Low-poly chest mesh with 16x16 texture
[ ] Controller support - Open containers with gamepad

PRIORITY 2 - Inventory Improvements (Quality of Life)
[ ] Item stacking - Wood (100), Stone (50), Food (20) stack limits
[ ] Auto-stack on pickup - Merge with existing stacks automatically
[ ] Stack count display - Visual indication of stack size
[ ] Inventory persistence - Stacks maintain across sessions (in-memory for now)

PRIORITY 3 - Workbench Foundation (Progression Gate)
[ ] Workbench placement - Craftable building block (10 wood + 5 stone)
[ ] Workbench visual design - Low-poly table/bench model
[ ] Proximity detection - Check player within 5m radius
[ ] Crafting UI integration - Show "Requires Workbench" on locked recipes

DEFERRED TO NEXT SPRINT:
[ ] Sort/Quick-stack buttons - Inventory organization helpers
[ ] New workbench recipes - Advanced crafting options (need design)
[ ] Container animations - Open/close lid animations
[ ] Drag-and-drop UI - Enhanced item transfer (start with click-to-move)
[ ] Container destruction/harvesting - Get materials back


DESIGN DECISIONS FOR THIS SPRINT:
----------------------------------
✅ Container UI: Click-to-transfer (simple), defer drag-and-drop
✅ Container scope: Harvestable chests (can break, get wood back, items drop)
✅ Stacking: Full implementation this sprint (critical for storage value)
✅ Workbench: Placement + proximity only, defer recipe gating to next sprint


NEXT UP (After Current Sprint)
-------------------------------
[ ] Workbench recipes - 5+ new recipes requiring workbench proximity
[ ] Sort/Quick-stack buttons - Complete inventory QoL features
[ ] Container visual polish - Animations, texture variations
[ ] Combat system - Basic enemy encounters with simple weapons
[ ] Save/load system - Persistent world state (HIGH PRIORITY after storage works)


BACKLOG (Prioritized)
---------------------
HIGH PRIORITY:
[ ] Save/load system - Persistent world state and player progress (NEXT after storage)
[ ] Boss progression system - Valheim-style boss encounters that gate biome access
[ ] Advanced building - Walls, roofs, furniture for proper base construction
[ ] Tool tiers - Stone → Iron → Steel progression path
[ ] Durability system - Tools degrade with use (creates resource sink)

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
[ ] Unique landmarks - Procedurally placed points of interest for discovery and exploration
[ ] Animal AI improvements - More realistic critter behaviors (feeding, fleeing, nesting)
[ ] Weather system - Rain, snow, storms that affect gameplay
[ ] Farming system - Plant crops, tend gardens for renewable food
[ ] NPC traders - Buy/sell resources, discover rare items
[ ] Character customization - Appearance options for player model
[ ] Controller UI navigation - D-Pad navigation through inventory/crafting menus with visual focus

LOW PRIORITY:
[ ] Performance stats UI - Display FPS, CPU, GPU, and memory usage in upper right corner
[ ] Custom skybox - Replace ProceduralSkyMaterial with custom texture/cubemap for enhanced atmosphere
[ ] Snow covered trees in snow biome - Visual enhancement for winter atmosphere
[ ] Multi-material terrain rendering - Replace vertex color tinting (see chunk.gd:231)
[ ] Seasonal changes - Visual and gameplay shifts throughout the year
[ ] Fishing system - Coastal/river fishing for food variety
[ ] Mounts/vehicles - Faster travel options for exploring large biomes
[ ] Music system - Ambient tracks that match biome/time of day
[ ] Controller rumble - Haptic feedback for harvesting, damage, and building


SOMEDAY/MAYBE (Ideas to explore)
---------------------------------
- Multiplayer co-op - Shared world building with friends
- Magic/enchanting system - Mystical progression path
- Underground/cave generation - Deeper exploration with mining
- Pet system - Tamed critters that follow and help
- Treasure hunting - Buried loot and rare discoveries

DESIGN QUESTIONS / DECISIONS NEEDED
------------------------------------
Sprint Planning Decisions (Made):
✅ Storage scope: Core + Polish approach (1 week timeline)
✅ Container UI: Click-to-transfer first, drag-and-drop later
✅ Container destruction: Harvestable (break to get materials back)
✅ Item stacking: Full implementation this sprint
✅ Workbench scope: Placement + proximity, defer recipe gating

Future Decisions (Still Open):
? Should tools degrade/break or have infinite durability? (affects resource loops)
? What should unlock new biomes - boss kills or tool upgrades? (progression pacing)
? Should building have structural integrity like Valheim or free placement like Minecraft?
? How rare should character trees be? (currently 5% - too common or too rare?)
? Should critters be harvestable for food/materials or purely ambient?
? Should controller vibration intensity be configurable in settings?
? Container limits: How many containers can exist in world simultaneously?
? Workbench limits: One per player or unlimited placement?


TECHNICAL DEBT / REFACTORING
-----------------------------
[X] Code organization - Extracted large tree generators into modular files (COMPLETE)
[ ] Multi-material terrain system - Replace vertex color tinting with proper material blending (chunk.gd)
[ ] Settings preset detection - "Custom" preset detection could be more robust
[ ] Resource spawning optimization - Could batch-spawn resources instead of one-at-a-time
[ ] Chunk unloading delay - Add graceful fade-out before unloading distant chunks
[ ] Critter spawner refactoring - Could extract critter visual generators (same pattern as vegetation)
[ ] Container persistence architecture - Design for future save/load system


BUGS / FIXES
------------
[X] Sun/moon seem to change sizes as I explore - FIXED
[X] Crabs still don't seem to spawn - FIXED
[X] Rocks are not glowing (blue-ish) at night (should behave just like mushrooms) - FIXED
[X] Trees sometimes breaking too early before hitting ground - FIXED (improved collision timing)
[X] Logs clipping through terrain - FIXED (spawn height adjustment, CylinderShape collision)


SPRINT RISK ASSESSMENT
-----------------------
🔴 HIGH RISK: Container UI complexity (dual-panel, transfer logic)
   Mitigation: Start simple with click-to-transfer, add features incrementally
   
🟡 MEDIUM RISK: Save compatibility for stacking changes
   Mitigation: Design inventory structure with future save system in mind
   
🟡 MEDIUM RISK: Controller UI navigation for containers
   Mitigation: Mouse/keyboard first, controller support second pass
   
🟢 LOW RISK: Feature creep
   Mitigation: Stick to acceptance criteria, defer extras to backlog


---
Notes:
- Project follows Valheim/Minecraft aesthetic: low-poly + 16x16 pixel textures
- Core loop: Explore → Gather → Craft → Build → Unlock new biomes → Repeat
- Tone: Cozy loneliness with meditative gathering and discovery moments
- All features should support "one more trip" addictive gathering loop
- Full controller support implemented - keyboard+mouse and Xbox controller work simultaneously
- Sprint planning focuses on "Core + Polish" approach: deliver complete, polished features over rushed completeness
