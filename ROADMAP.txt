CRIMSON VEIL - FEATURE ROADMAP
================================

CURRENT SPRINT (Next 1-2 weeks)
--------------------------------
[ ] Biome-specific resources - Unique materials in each biome (desert cacti, snow ice, etc)
[ ] Crafting system - Simple crafting recipes to convert resources into tools/items
[ ] Inventory UI - Visual display of collected resources and equipped tools


IN PROGRESS
-----------
[X] Tool system - Add basic tools (axe, pickaxe) required for harvesting (COMPLETE)
[X] Harvesting system - Trees, strawberries, mushrooms with particles and UI feedback (COMPLETE)
[X] Day/night cycle - Time-based lighting with sun/moon visuals (COMPLETE)
[X] Settings system - Graphics, display, performance options (COMPLETE)


NEXT UP (This Month)
--------------------
[ ] Combat system - Basic enemy encounters with simple weapons
[ ] Health/hunger mechanics - Survival needs that create resource loops
[ ] Storage containers - Chests/boxes to organize gathered materials
[ ] Building upgrades - Workbenches unlock advanced crafting recipes


BACKLOG (Prioritized)
---------------------
HIGH PRIORITY:
[ ] Boss progression system - Valheim-style boss encounters that gate biome access
[ ] Advanced building - Walls, roofs, furniture for proper base construction
[ ] Save/load system - Persistent world state and player progress

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
[ ] Unique landmarks - Procedurally placed points of interest for discovery and exploration
[ ] Animal AI improvements - More realistic critter behaviors (feeding, fleeing, nesting)
[ ] Weather system - Rain, snow, storms that affect gameplay
[ ] Farming system - Plant crops, tend gardens for renewable food
[ ] NPC traders - Buy/sell resources, discover rare items
[ ] Character customization - Appearance options for player model

LOW PRIORITY:
[ ] Performance stats UI - Display FPS, CPU, GPU, and memory usage in upper right corner
[ ] Custom skybox - Replace ProceduralSkyMaterial with custom texture/cubemap for enhanced atmosphere
[ ] Snow covered trees in snow biome - Visual enhancement for winter atmosphere
[ ] Multi-material terrain rendering - Replace vertex color tinting (see chunk.gd:231)
[ ] Seasonal changes - Visual and gameplay shifts throughout the year
[ ] Fishing system - Coastal/river fishing for food variety
[ ] Mounts/vehicles - Faster travel options for exploring large biomes
[ ] Music system - Ambient tracks that match biome/time of day


SOMEDAY/MAYBE (Ideas to explore)
---------------------------------
- Multiplayer co-op - Shared world building with friends
- Magic/enchanting system - Mystical progression path
- Underground/cave generation - Deeper exploration with mining
- Pet system - Tamed critters that follow and help
- Treasure hunting - Buried loot and rare discoveries
- Photography mode - Capture and share scenic moments


COMPLETED (Recent)
------------------
[X] Procedural world generation - Chunk-based terrain with FastNoiseLite
[X] Day/night cycle with pixelated sun/moon - Time-based sky colors and celestial bodies
[X] Harvestable resources - Trees, strawberries, mushrooms with proper collision
[X] Harvest particles - Minecraft-style pixel "poof" effects when gathering
[X] Harvest UI feedback - Progress bar and resource name display
[X] Tree falling physics - Trees tip over when chopped down (Valheim-style)
[X] Resource night glow - Mushrooms and strawberries emit light at night
[X] Critter spawning - Rabbits, deer, birds, lizards, crabs with procedural placement
[X] Settings menu - Resolution, fullscreen, vsync, MSAA, quality presets
[X] Water plane - Infinite ocean with collision for walking


DESIGN QUESTIONS / DECISIONS NEEDED
------------------------------------
? Should tools degrade/break or have infinite durability? (affects resource loops)
? What should unlock new biomes - boss kills or tool upgrades? (progression pacing)
? Should building have structural integrity like Valheim or free placement like Minecraft?
? How rare should character trees be? (currently 5% - too common or too rare?)
? Should critters be harvestable for food/materials or purely ambient?


TECHNICAL DEBT / REFACTORING
-----------------------------
[ ] Multi-material terrain system - Replace vertex color tinting with proper material blending (chunk.gd)
[ ] Collision edge-case handling - Sometimes trees fall through terrain on slopes
[ ] Settings preset detection - "Custom" preset detection could be more robust
[ ] Resource spawning optimization - Could batch-spawn resources instead of one-at-a-time
[ ] Chunk unloading delay - Add graceful fade-out before unloading distant chunks


BUGS / FIXES
------------
[X] Sun/moon seem to change sizes as I explore - FIXED
[X] Crabs still don't seem to spawn - FIXED
[X] Rocks are not glowing (blue-ish) at night (should behave just like mushrooms) - FIXED


---
Notes:
- Project follows Valheim/Minecraft aesthetic: low-poly + 16x16 pixel textures
- Core loop: Explore â†’ Gather â†’ Craft â†’ Build â†’ Unlock new biomes â†’ Repeat
- Tone: Cozy loneliness with meditative gathering and discovery moments
- All features should support "one more trip" addictive gathering loop
