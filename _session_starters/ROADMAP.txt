CRIMSON VEIL - ROADMAP

CURRENT: v0.5.0 "Atmosphere & Audio" (10/13 tasks - 77%)
========================================================

DESIGN DECISIONS (LOCKED):
✓ Music: Pure ambient drone (minimal, non-intrusive)
✓ Footsteps: Biome-aware (4 surfaces: grass/stone/sand/snow)
✓ Volume: Hybrid (realistic ambient, punchy actions)
✓ Music variety: Day/night variation (8 tracks total)

THIS SPRINT:
[X] 1.1 - Audio Manager Architecture
[X] 1.2 - AI Sound Generation (48 files: 40 SFX + 8 music)
[X] 1.3 - Harvesting Sounds
[X] 2.1 - Movement Sounds (footsteps)
[X] 2.2 - Music Manager & AI Music
[X] 2.3 - Ambient Environmental Sounds
[X] 2.4 - Building Sounds
[X] 2.5 - Container Sounds
[X] 3.1 - UI Sounds (inventory, crafting, pickup, tool switch, warnings, settings, ESC feedback)
      → 32 sound integration points across 5 scripts
      → Fixed ESC key mapping bug
      → Fixed chest double-open bug
      → Complete audio coverage for all UI interactions
[X] 3.2 - Settings Menu Audio Controls
[ ] 3.3 - Sound Variation System
[ ] 3.4 - Audio Balance Pass
[ ] 3.5 - Controller Rumble (OPTIONAL)

NEXT SPRINT IDEAS:
- Workbench system (proximity crafting)
- Save/load (HIGH PRIORITY - complex)
- Inventory organization (sort, quick-stack)
- Combat system (new major system)
- Advanced building (walls, roofs, furniture)

BACKLOG (HIGH PRIORITY):
- Save/load system (complex serialization)
- Boss progression (Valheim-style gates)
- Tool tiers (stone → iron → steel)
- Durability system (resource sink)
- Workbench & advanced crafting
- Advanced building blocks

TECH DEBT:
[ ] Critter visual extraction (reduce critter_spawner.gd from 1,143 lines)
[ ] ITEM_COLORS consolidation (remove duplication from inventory_ui.gd + container_ui.gd)
[ ] Container null safety (race condition if destroyed while UI open)
[ ] Input handling consolidation (player.gd uses duplicate input checks)
[ ] Cloud system extraction (day_night_cycle.gd is 829 lines)

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Container destroyed while UI open (needs null checks)
- Input blocking too broad (player.gd:148)

FIXED IN v0.5.0:
- ✓ ESC key not mapped properly (ui_cancel had physical_keycode: -1)
- ✓ Chest open sound playing multiple times (added UI visibility check)
- ✓ Settings menu parser error (can't override show() in Godot 4)

COMPLETED SPRINTS:
v0.4.0 (Dec 12, 2025) - Storage & Organization (11/15 tasks - 73%)
v0.3.0 - Building & Crafting
v0.2.0 - World Generation
v0.1.0 - Foundation

---
Game: Low-poly survival (Valheim/Minecraft aesthetic)
Tone: Cozy loneliness with meditative gathering
Loop: Explore → Gather → Craft → Build → Unlock biomes → Repeat
