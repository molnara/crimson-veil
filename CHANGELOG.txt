Format: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - Brief description of change

Recent Changes (v0.3.0+):
-------------------------
[2024-12-10 XX:XX] [MAJOR] Added biome generation configuration - exposed noise scales and thresholds in Inspector for biome size/shape control
[2024-12-10 XX:XX] [MAJOR] Added biome-specific vegetation configuration - per-biome density controls in Inspector (forest trees, grassland strawberries, etc)
[2024-12-10 XX:XX] [FEATURE] Guaranteed Grassland spawn zone - 100m radius around origin always Grassland (Valheim-style safe spawning)
[2024-12-10 XX:XX] [MINOR] Added spawn_zone_radius export variable (50-300m configurable radius)
[2024-12-10 XX:XX] [MINOR] Added temperature_scale, moisture_scale controls for biome size tuning
[2024-12-10 XX:XX] [MINOR] Added configurable biome thresholds (ocean/beach/mountain/snow/desert/forest levels)
[2024-12-10 XX:XX] [MAJOR] Biome-specific vegetation distributions - forests now oak-only with increased mushrooms, grasslands feature strawberries, mountains have sparse pines
[2024-12-10 XX:XX] [MINOR] Removed pine trees from forests (forests now 100% oak trees for distinct identity)
[2024-12-10 XX:XX] [MINOR] Removed strawberries from forests (now grassland-exclusive resource)
[2024-12-10 XX:XX] [MINOR] Added sparse pine trees to mountains (25% density to reduce barren feel)
[2024-12-10 XX:XX] [MINOR] Increased mushroom spawn in forests (0.50 vs 0.35 - signature forest resource)
[2024-12-10 XX:XX] [MINOR] Increased strawberry spawn in grasslands (0.55 vs 0.40 - signature grassland resource)
[2024-12-10 XX:XX] [MINOR] Updated ROADMAP.txt - added biome configuration options as high priority
[2024-12-11 02:00] [MAJOR] Refactored vegetation_spawner.gd - extracted tree generators to separate files (reduced from 2,075 to 1,457 lines)
[2024-12-10 20:00] [MAJOR] Added grid-based inventory UI - 8x4 visual slots, Tab to toggle
[2024-12-10 19:30] [MAJOR] Added crafting system - 5 starter recipes with UI (Press R to open)
[2024-12-10 23:45] [MAJOR] Rewrote cloud system using Perlin noise - organic shapes, no straight edges
[2024-12-10 23:40] [MINOR] Added cloud noise parameters to Inspector (5 adjustable settings)
[2024-12-10 23:35] [FIX] Fixed sun/moon rendering order - moved to z=Â±500 for proper depth sorting
[2024-12-10 23:15] [MINOR] Enhanced crosshair design - cross-shaped with outline for better visibility
[2024-12-10 21:30] [FEATURE] Added harvest highlight system - green outline for correct tool, red for wrong tool
[2024-12-10 20:45] [FIX] Fixed sun/moon size changing bug - celestial bodies now positioned relative to player
[2024-12-10 20:15] [FIX] Fixed crab spawning bug - crabs now spawn on beach biomes with proper height threshold
[2024-12-10 19:45] [FIX] Fixed rock nighttime glow - rocks now glow blue-gray at night like other resources
[2024-12-10 18:30] [MINOR] Updated ROADMAP.txt - organized priorities, added bugs, moved tool system to completed
[2024-12-10 17:15] [MINOR] Updated DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md - clarified commit workflow
[2024-12-10 16:45] [MINOR] Added real-time tool indicator updates when cycling tools
[2024-12-10 16:30] [MINOR] Added visual indicator (red text) when wrong tool equipped
[2024-12-10 16:00] [MAJOR] Added minimal tool system - Axe/Pickaxe with requirement checking
[2024-12-10 15:30] - Created ROADMAP.txt with current features and planned work
[2024-12-10 15:35] - Created CHANGELOG.txt to track session changes
